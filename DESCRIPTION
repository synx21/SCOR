Description: A package to solve optimization problem where parameters belong to the surface of unit hyper-sphere.This package also includes functions to obtain optimal coefficients for combining multiple bio-markers for classification of multi-class disease outcome categories, using different criteria namely Empirical Hyper-volume Under Maniforlds (EHUM), Smooth approximation of the empirical Hyper-volume Under Maniforlds (SHUM) and Upper and Lower Bound Approach on empirical hyper-volume under maniforlds (ULBA).
